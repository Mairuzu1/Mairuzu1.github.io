## To create your own: 
Used https://pages.github.com/ as reference

[1] Create a repository with your username.

[2] Clone the repository to a remote or local machine.
	
	git clone username.github.io

[3] With your terminal, make your way to the folder directory using "cd yourdirectory"

[4] Once you are satisfied with the content, you can push your content with the following commands
	
	git add -A
	git commit -m "This is a sample commit message"
	git push -u origin main

## Some takeaways:
[1] I learned how to utilize the use of Flexboxes for ease of use,

[2] I used Git CMD for remote access and pushing of commits.

[3] I was able to deploy a webpage with the use of github pages.
